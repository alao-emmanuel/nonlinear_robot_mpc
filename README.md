# nonlinear_robot_mpc

    A simulation of an autonomous robot moving in crowd of pedestrians towards a desired goal
    The navigation strategy is based on a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (nonlinear MPC).
    Where the control inputs of the robot are computed using the direct multiple shooting method.
    Hence, the navigation problem is modelled as a boundary value problem using an optimization objective function
    and constraints based on the motion of the robot and pedestrians.
